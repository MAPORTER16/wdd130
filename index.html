        <p>Hello, my name is Matthew Porter! I grew up in Tooele Utah and later on moved to Eagle Mountain Utah. I
            graduated from Westlake Highschool
            and served a mission in the Alabama Birmmingham Mission.
            I've been married for 3 years now. I'm huge into nerdy stuff like Lord of the Rings,
            D&D, Warhammer, etc. Just a huge nerd. I like to spend time with my family, and I love to workout. I also
            love dogs.</p>
